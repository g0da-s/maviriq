# Golden test cases for Maviriq agent evaluation.
#
# Each case defines a business idea plus expected properties that graders
# check against real agent output.  Start with ~25 cases spanning:
#   - obviously_bad   : should get SKIP
#   - saturated        : should get SKIP or MAYBE (crowded market)
#   - niche_viable     : should get MAYBE or BUILD
#   - obviously_good   : should get BUILD or MAYBE with high pain
#   - already_failed   : should get SKIP, graveyard should find evidence
#
# Fields per case:
#   id            – unique slug
#   idea          – the business idea string (what the user types)
#   category      – one of the five categories above
#   expected_verdict – list of acceptable verdicts, first = most likely
#   min_pain_points  – minimum pain points Pain Discovery should find
#   min_competitors  – minimum competitors Competitor Research should find
#   known_competitors – names that SHOULD appear (substring match)
#   expected_saturation – expected market_saturation value(s)
#   confidence_range   – [low, high] acceptable confidence window
#   notes         – human rationale for the expectations
